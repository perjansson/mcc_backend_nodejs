Meeting Cost Calculator - backend
==================

Backend for Meeting cost calculator, implemented in Node.js.

I'm building Meeting cost calculator mostly to try out and learn different frameworks, techniques and patterns. But also little bit because I think quite a lot of meetings are a waste of time. Some of them are good, some of them are necessary, but some of them are just a waste of time and money.

Frontend for Meeting cost calculator (built with Angular.js, jQuery, Bootstrap etc) can be found <a href="https://github.com/perjansson/mcc">here</a>.
